# MNIST-Logistic-Regression-Pytorch

The MNIST dataset is a dataset familiar to everyone working in the field of Machine Learning. The feature of this dataset is that this dataset, which was developed in the middle of the 20th century, contains 60000 handwritten letters and numbers. In this study, the numbers in the MNIST data set were classified.

There are 10 different types of digits in the data set; 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10

Inputs are images with a size of 28x28 pixels. The images have been rendered 2D due to filtering and processing.

In this study, Logistic Regression was performed using the Pytorch library. Logistic Regression is the simplest artificial neural network used for binary classification.
